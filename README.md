vagrant-lxc
===========

Install Vagrant with LXC in an Ubuntu VM.

This is a horrible theft of other people's hard work, that, when run in an 
Ubuntu 13.04 VM in VirtualBox, should download, install and configure all you 
need to run Vagrant LXC containers inside your Ubuntu VM.

It can also create a couple of new LXC containers using an Ubuntu Precise box 
it builds. (This will mean Precise containers with a Raring kernel, of course.)
